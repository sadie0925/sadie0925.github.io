C++ is one of the coding language and known as harder than java or python due to memory handling and operator overloading. C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. 

## Before heading to learn C++ in earnest

|Word|Definition|
|:-------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Default|The preexisting value of a user-configurable setting that is assigned to a software application, computer program or device|
|Scope|A region of the the program where a defined variable can have its exitence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed|
|Terminate|The process of stopping a running software program or permanently removing a program from a computer|
|Compute|Making a calculation during using computer|
|ASCH|128 characters<br />ex) ! " # $ % & ' ( ) x + , / _ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ; : < = > ? . etc.|
|Library|The solution for collecting related functions together for reuse in c++<br />->Suppose you need information on something:<br /> You go to an appropriate library, and access that book|
|Compile|Compiling allows the computer to run and understand the program without the need of the programming software used to create it|toj
|Statement|Introduction(declaration) of a name (;identifiers)|
|A block of statements|=the function body. Zero/more statements surrounded by braces|

## Function

How to write function:
1. Use library before any function declaration or definition:<br />Usually, iostream is used. isotream means "Several standard stream objects". Library can be used depending on user's needs such as string, error handling and numerics library.
2. Always create function declaration before function definition:<br />Function Declaration - A statement as it ends in a semicolon<br />ex)int main();<br />->tells compiler that main is going to be a function<br />Function Definition - instead of ";", block of statements<br />->immediately follows the name in the function definition that will be executed one at a time when the function is called
3. Display your code according to what you need using if statement, while or for loop. 
If statement:
'''
if ( Boolean-valued condition ) {
    // The consequent block or body of statements 
    // to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // The alternative block or body of statements
    // - to be executed if the condition is false
}
'''
